  abstract = {In the real world all events are connected. There is a hidden
              network of dependencies that governs behavior of natural processes.
              Without much argument it can be said that, of all the known
              data-structures, graphs are naturally suitable to model such
              information. But to learn to use graph data structure is a tedious
              job as most operations on graphs are computationally expensive, so
              exploring fast machine learning techniques for graph data has been
              an active area of research and a family of algorithms called kernel
              based approaches has been famous among researchers of the machine
              learning domain. With the help of support vector machines, kernel
              based methods work very well for learning with Gaussian processes.
              In this survey we will explore various kernels that operate on
              graph representations. Starting from the basics of kernel based
              learning we will travel through the history of graph kernels from
              its first appearance to discussion of current state of the art
              techniques in practice.},
