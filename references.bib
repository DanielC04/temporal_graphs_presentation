  abstract = "A temporal graph is, informally speaking, a graph that changes
              with time. When time is discrete and only the relationships between
              the participating entities may change and not the entities
              themselves, a temporal graph may be viewed as a sequence {\$}{\$}G{
              \_}1,G{\_}2{\backslash}ldots ,G{\_}l{\$}{\$}of static graphs over
              the same (static) set of nodes V. Though static graphs have been
              extensively studied, for their temporal generalization we are still
              far from having a concrete set of structural and algorithmic
              principles. Recent research shows that many graph properties and
              problems become radically different and usually substantially more
              difficult when an extra time dimension in added to them. Moreover,
              there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of modern systems
              and applications that can be naturally modeled and studied via
              temporal graphs. This, further motivates the need for the
              development of a temporal extension of graph theory. We survey here
              recent results on temporal graphs and temporal graph problems that
              have appeared in the Computer Science community.",

  abstract = {In the real world all events are connected. There is a hidden
              network of dependencies that governs behavior of natural processes.
              Without much argument it can be said that, of all the known
              data-structures, graphs are naturally suitable to model such
              information. But to learn to use graph data structure is a tedious
              job as most operations on graphs are computationally expensive, so
              exploring fast machine learning techniques for graph data has been
              an active area of research and a family of algorithms called kernel
              based approaches has been famous among researchers of the machine
              learning domain. With the help of support vector machines, kernel
              based methods work very well for learning with Gaussian processes.
              In this survey we will explore various kernels that operate on
              graph representations. Starting from the basics of kernel based
              learning we will travel through the history of graph kernels from
              its first appearance to discussion of current state of the art
              techniques in practice.},

  abstract = {Shortest path is a fundamental graph problem with numerous
              applications. However, the concept of classic shortest path is
              insufficient or even flawed in a temporal graph, as the temporal
              information determines the order of activities along any path. In
              this paper, we show the shortcomings of classic shortest path in a
              temporal graph, and study various concepts of "shortest" path for
              temporal graphs. Computing these temporal paths is challenging as
              subpaths of a "shortest" path may not be "shortest" in a temporal
              graph. We investigate properties of the temporal paths and propose
              efficient algorithms to compute them. We tested our algorithms on
              real world temporal graphs to verify their efficiency, and also
              show that temporal paths are essential for studying temporal graphs
              by comparing shortest paths in normal static graphs.},

              connectivity), and the SIS (susceptible/infected/susceptible, flu
              like) virus propagation model, what can we say about its epidemic
              threshold? That is, can we determine when a small infection will
              ``take-off'' and create an epidemic? Consequently then, which nodes
              should we immunize to prevent an epidemic? This is a very real
              problem, since, e.g. people have different connections during the
              day at work, and during the night at home. Static graphs have been
              studied for a long time, with numerous analytical results.
              Time-evolving networks are so hard to analyze, that most existing
              works are simulation studies [5].",
